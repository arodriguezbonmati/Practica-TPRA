# Practica-mejorada

Improved the first project which consisted on creating an ecommerce platform with Java.

HOW TO USE:

1)When you run the project you are required a username and a password to enter the shop. Username=qwerty Password=qwerty1234.

2)Once inside the shop you have 2 options. The first one is for buying either books or movies (by reading the instructions and typing the correct numbers. The other option is a € to $ converter. You enter the amount of € you want to convert, press 1 and you have the conversion done.

3)Leave the shop.

CLASSES:

-Main: Contains the method for the currency conversion and the main menu.

-Book and Movie: Each class contains its constructor, getters and setters and method.

-User: Contains the constructor and getters and setters for the log in information: username, email and password.

-Test Classes: Here you can test the classes.

-MyException: Here I tried to develop my own exceptions.

IMPROVEMENTS:

1)Log in: Before the username and password were barely used but now they are needed to gain access to the shop.

2)Stock: Improved Book and Movie and now there is a proper "catalogue" where you can see each products' name, genre, stock and price.

3)Resource leaks: Fixed all the warnings for resource leak on the project.

4)Tests: I learned how to do tests and the utility they have.

5)Exceptions: I learned how exceptions work, and what are the different kinds of them, but I did not know how to use them in my project.
